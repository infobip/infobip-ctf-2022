I have been working on this new technology that will forever change mankind. Check this binary that loads string parts and then glues them together in a one single string blob. Here is my proof-of-concept. I am going to meet with a few investors next week in order to pitch this tech. Hopefully they will understand that this idea will make the world a better place.
